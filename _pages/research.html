          <h3 class="entry-title">Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) | Team Member, Honorable Mention</h3>
          <span class="entry-date">Jan. 2025</span>
        </div>
        <ul class="entry-details">
          <li>Developed a multi-objective optimization model to guide public spending in Juneau and Barcelona amid overtourism, balancing tourism growth, environmental protection, infrastructure capacity, and resident satisfaction.</li>
          <li>Applied AHP and regression analysis to standardize indicators and calibrate model parameters; proposed various weight allocation strategies to reflect policy trade-offs.</li>
          <li>Assessed fiscal plans using historical and forecasted data; validated model robustness through sensitivity analysis.</li>

          <h3 class="entry-title">Course Project | Introduction to Financial Data Analysis, PKU | Team Member</h3>
          <span class="entry-date">Nov. - Dec. 2024</span>
        </div>
        <p class="entry-topic"><strong>Topic:</strong> Equity Investment Strategy Based on Technical Indicators and Machine Learning</p>
        <ul class="entry-details">
          <li>Assessed technical indicators (skewness, kurtosis, correlation) and developed momentum strategies (EMA, RSI, MACD) for China Everbright Bank; evaluated via Sharpe ratio, annualized return, and maximum drawdown.</li>
          <li>Predicted stock returns using machine learning models (decision trees, random forest, and Naïve Bayes), examined the correlation between technical indicators and returns, and optimized model hyperparameters.</li>
          <li>Applied PCA to reduce indicator dimensionality and identify key features (e.g. CCI, MACD), explored solutions for return decay after 2020 by building rolling forecast models using a 3-year moving window, and backtested model performance across different market regimes.</li>
